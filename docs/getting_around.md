# Local Transportation

In general there are 4 kinds of local ticket:

- **Kurzstrecke** for very short trips
- **Einzelfahrschein** for 1 trip
- **Tageskarte** work for the whole day (in some city only until midnight, not 24 hours)
- **Wochenkarte** work for 1 week
- **Monatkarte** work for 1 month

In most city **tickets need to be activated before use!!!!!** See [here](https://welcome2berlin.weebly.com/berlin-ticket-machine.html). If you are travelling alone for the first time, I would advise using kurzstrecke tickets as the rule on them may vary from city to city

# Train

Order train ticket via [Bahn.de](https://www.bahn.de) or [Omio](https://omio.de). If you are travelling in a group and did not use any EC, IC, or ICE, you might wanna look at [QDL Ticket](https://www.bahn.de/angebot/regio/qdl). If you are travelling in a group with IC, EC, or ICE, it might be cheaper to use [Gruppen Ticket](https://www.bahn.de/angebot/sparpreis-flexpreis/sparpreis-gruppes). During summer months there is usually [Summer Tickets](https://www.sommer-ticket-bahn.de/) where you can pay 90 Euros for 4 trip from any two poin in Germany.s

**Make sure you sit where you are assigned on your ticket!** Sometime a train from Berlin to Konstanz might be a joined train for the route Berlin - Konstanz and Berlin - MÃ¼nchen but get splitted in Frankfurt without passanger disembarkation.

If you miss your transit train, find the DB Information Center explain to them nicely that you have missed your transit and they will give you new tickets and new train connection information

# Bus 
 
You can buy intercity bus on [Omio](https://www.omio.de) or directly from the bus provider. Flixbus usually offer discount for students so google before you buy any ticket
