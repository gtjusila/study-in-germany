# Buying A Phone Number

- Aldi Talk is the cheapest, but if you still expect to travel a lot, Vodafone or O2 is your best bet.
- Phone Number needs to be activated, the last time someone used Vodafone there seems to be a bit of a problem activating online (system changed from last year), activating at a post office might be your best bet here. Buying a phone number directly from a mobile phone shop is impossible because of corona rules.
