# Welcome to Study in Germany Cookbook

## About this Cookbook

This cookbook is a tiny list of tips and tricks that I (Gennesaret Tjusila) and other friends have collected living in Germany over the past couple of years. It is an open repository on [GitHub] so feel free to contribute to this project.
